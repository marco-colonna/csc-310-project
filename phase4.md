### Revised paper prototype

The first change we made to our prototype was to help make the fast startup setting easier to find (Marco-1 Line 37, 56-57; Aaron-2 Line 15-18; Ella-1 Line 36). It was previously placed under the "Shutdown settings" tab, but to make the setting's location more obvious we updated the name of the tab to "Startup and shutdown settings." We also updated the name of one of the two video settings we had within the "Advanced settings" tab, as some users had trouble differentiating between the two settings (Marco-1 Line 46-47, 59; Aaron-1 Line 13; Ella-1 Line 43). To fix this we "Video playback quality bias" to "Video playback priority" to better communicate that this settings controls the priority of the computer when performing video playback. Finally, we updated the "Default settings" to "Preset settings" and added (i) buttons to the options which provide brief descriptions of the presets and what settings they will change. This update was made because some users found these settings unclear or wanted more information on the settings and how they would work (Marco-1 Line 46, 59; Aaron-1 Line 15; Ella-2 Line 43, 49).
