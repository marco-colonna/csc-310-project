## Phase 1: Pick a system and representative tasks

System name: Windows 10 Power & sleep settings

### System Description
Windows Settings is a component of Microsoft Windows Operating System. It allows users to adjust their user preferences. Power & sleep settings allow the user to have greater control over their device's efficiency regarding battery life and power consumption as well as the function of the power button or closing the lid of a laptop computer. This can majorly affect the experience and performance of a user's device, so it must be as simple to understand and use as possible while still fitting with the flow and style of the Windows operating system.

### Representative tasks

1. Change the screen to turn off after 1 minute.
2. Change the PC to go to sleep after 1 hour.
3. Set the hard disk to never turn off.
4. Change playing video to optimize video quality.
5. Set the power plan to High performance.
6. Customize your own power plan.
7. Set the power plan to your custom power plan.
