## Phase 1: Pick a system and representative tasks

### System Name
Windows 10 Power & sleep settings

### System Description
Windows Settings is a component of Microsoft Windows Operating System. It allows users to adjust their user preferences regarding many functions of their device. Power & sleep settings allow the user to have greater control over their device's efficiency regarding battery life and power consumption as well as the function of the power button or closing the lid of a laptop computer. This can majorly affect the experience and performance of a user's device, so it must be as simple to understand and use as possible while still fitting with the flow and style of the Windows operating system.

### Representative tasks

1. Change the screen to turn off after 1 minute.
2. Change the PC to go to sleep after 1 hour.
3. Set the hard disk to never turn off.
4. Change playing video to optimize video quality.
5. Set the power plan to High performance.
6. Customize your own power plan.
7. Set the power plan to your custom power plan.
8. Change the power button to put the computer to sleep.
9. Turn on fast startup.
10. Allow the Hibernate option to show in the Power menu.

### Questionnaire

**Pre-study:**

1. Have you touched the power & sleep settings in Windows 10?
2. Have you touched the power & sleep settings in a different version of Windows?
3. Have you touched the power & sleep settings in a different operating system? (macOS, Linux, iOS, etc.)

If yes to any of these questions:

4. How often do you use the power & sleep settings?
5. When was the last time you used the power & sleep settings?
6. What was your experience last time?
7. What prompts you to change the power & sleep settings?
8. What settings do you change the most?
9. What settings do you search for the most?
10. What problems did you encounter when changing the power & sleep settings?

**Post-study:**

1. Which of these settings have you changed before?
2. Of the settings you haven't changed before, are there any settings you would now change on your own computer?
3. What settings were you satisfied with the process of changing?
4. Which settings were the hardest for you to change?
5. What improvements would you suggest to the power & sleep settings?

### Script

Hello [subject], my name is [surveyor]. Thank you for participating in our study. I am a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan Flint. I am a member of a group working on a project for our Human Computer Interaction course.

We are studying the Windows power and sleep settings and hope to improve the user experience. To do this, I'm going to ask you to perform some tasks that will help us determine any issues with the system.

Before we begin, I’d like to ask you some questions about your experience with Windows power and sleep settings.

1. Have you touched the power & sleep settings in Windows 10?
2. Have you touched the power & sleep settings in a different version of Windows?
3. Have you touched the power & sleep settings in a different operating system? (macOS, Linux, iOS, etc.)

If yes to any of these questions:

4. How often do you use the power & sleep settings?
5. When was the last time you used the power & sleep settings?
6. What was your experience last time?
7. What prompts you to change the power & sleep settings?
8. What settings do you change the most?
9. What settings do you search for the most?
10. What problems did you encounter when changing the power & sleep settings?

**End of Pre-study**

Thank you for your answers. We are going to move on to the tasks now.

I'm going to ask you to perform some tasks. I will only tell you what to do and not how to do it. We will not be judging your performance. Our goal is to find issues with the system so any difficulty you have performing the tasks is actually what we are looking for. This means we can work on improving that component of the system. Please feel free to talk through your thought process to give us as much insight as possible. This will help us to be more effective in improving the system.

We have pulled up the Windows 10 Power & sleep settings for you.

First, change the screen to turn off after 1 minute.

Now change the PC to go to sleep after 1 hour.

Can you set the hard disk to never turn off?

I'd like you to change playing video to optimize video quality.

Great. Can you set the power plan to High performance?

I'd like you to customize your own power plan.

Then, can you set the power plan to your custom power plan?

Now change the power button to put the computer to sleep.

Can you turn on fast startup?

Now allow the Hibernate option to show in the Power menu.

Thank you for going through those tasks. Now I have some final questions to ask you about your experience.

**Post-study**

1. Which of these settings have you changed before?
2. Of the settings you haven't changed before, are there any settings you would now change on your own computer?
3. What settings were you satisfied with the process of changing?
4. Which settings were the hardest for you to change?
5. What improvements would you suggest to the power & sleep settings?

Thank you for participating in this study. This is very helpful feedback for how we can improve these settings for our project.
