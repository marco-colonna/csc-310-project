### Assumptions

#### Design Rationale

In this project, we came up with three collaborative sketches for this problem. The difference between them mainly stems from how the settings are organized. In sketch #1, all of the settings are together on one screen, while on sketch #2, the settings are split up into different screens, and in sketch #3 there are tabs for the different groups of settings, as well as a pop up for advanced settings. The other difference is that sketch #1 has removed power plans. Sketch #1 has the advantage of keeping everything on one screen. Sketch #2 and #3 both allow some level of splitting up to make things less cluttered. In the end we picked sketch #1 because we believe the user will have an easier time finding things.

We incorporated a few things we learned from our contextual inquiry into our design. First, we made sure that settings are easily accessible without having to navigate to another screen. In addition, we kept the duration the screen and the device stay on at the very beginning, since it is very common for users to want to change those settings. Finally, we made sure to put related settings together.

#### Hardware Assumptions

Our user interface is to replace the power and sleep settings on windows. Because of that, our target device is mainly laptop and desktop computers. These kinds of devices usually have mice, although sometimes they can have touchscreens.

#### User Assumptions

We expect all kinds of users to want to change the power settings on their devices. This includes users that may not be familiar with computers.

#### Tasks

1. Change the screen to turn off after 1 minute.
2. Change the computer to go to sleep after 1 hour.
3. Set the power button to put the computer to sleep.
4. Turn on fast startup.
5. Allow the Hibernate option to show in the Power menu.
6. Set the hard disk to never turn off.
7. Change playing video to optimize video quality.
8. Set the settings to the high performance default settings.

#### Sequence

1. Click on the drop-down next to "Turn off screen after" and choose 1 minute.
2. Click on the drop-down next to "Sleep after" and choose 1 hour.
3. Maximize the "Power and sleep button settings" tab, click on the drop-down next to "When I press the power button" and choose sleep.
4. Maximize the "Shutdown settings" tab and click on the box next to "Turn on fast startup."
5. Maximize the "Shutdown settings" tab and click on the box next to "Show Hibernate in Power menu."
6. Maximize the "Advanced power settings" tab, click on the drop-down next to "Turn off hard disk after" and choose never.
7. Maximize the "Advanced power settings" tab, click on the drop-down next to "When playing video" and choose optimize video quality.
8. Maximize the "Default settings" tab and click on the "Change" button next to "Set to high performance settings."

#### Instruction

1. First, change the screen to turn off after 1 minute.
2. Now change the computer to go to sleep after 1 hour.
3. Can you set the power button to put the computer to sleep?
4. I'd like you to turn on fast startup.
5. Great. Can you allow the Hibernate option to show in the Power menu?
6. I'd like you to set the hard disk to never turn off.
7. Then, can you change playing video to optimize video quality?
8. Now set the settings to the high performance default settings.
